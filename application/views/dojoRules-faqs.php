<div class="title">What is Karate?</div>
<p>
	Karate is a method of unarmed self-defense which was developed on the
	island of Okinawa. The term <span class="japaneseTerm">Kara-te</span>
	literally means &#8220;empty hand.&#8221; The benefits of karate
	training extend far beyond self-defense; it is also a method for
	personal development as well. Karate practitioners develop character
	through training and learn a great deal about themselves as a person.
	Karate is a lifelong process.
</p>
<div class="title">Who Can Learn Karate?</div>
<p>Karate is for everyone, regardless of age or physical condition.
	Conditioning and stamina will improve through training. The benefits of
	training are cumulative so the beginning student should be prepared to
	practice a minimum of two or three days per week. Advanced students can
	practice more, however should be careful to avoid overtraining. Karate
	training is a lifelong endeavor; it cannot be learned in one day. Pace
	yourself.</p>
<div class="title">What Will I Need To Practice?</div>
<p>
	Students are required to have a clean, white uniform, or <span
		class="japaneseTerm">gi</span>, with an ISKF patch on the left breast
	area. Men are encouraged to wear a supporter and/or cup; women a white sports
	bra or tee-shirt underneath. This all the equipment you will need to
	practice. Additional items for the future include sparring gloves and a
	mouthpiece. Supplemental equipment can include: Best Karate books,
	(volumes 1, 2 and 5 initially) videos of <span class="japaneseTerm">katas</span>,
	a bag to carry your equipment and training tape.
</p>
<div class="title">When Can I Start?</div>
<p>You can begin your training after you sign the waiver forms, pay your
	dues and have your uniform. Be on time or, even early, to class. It is
	disrespectful to come late to class. If you are late, you must bow and
	be recognized before being allowed to enter. Do not embarrass yourself
	further by disrupting the class in progress. Once you begin the class,
	you are expected to give your best effort. If you need to leave early,
	you must let your instructor know in advance.</p>
