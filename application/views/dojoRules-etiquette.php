</p>
<p>
	Shotokan is a traditional Japanese martial art and, as such, the
	guidelines of behavior and etiquette in the <span class="japaneseTerm">dojo</span>
	are the same as if you were training in Japan. You are required to show
	the proper respect to the <span class="japaneseTerm">shomen, sensei</span>
	and the <span class="japaneseTerm">sempai</span> (senior students) at
	all times. In addition, you must show respect to the training facility
	by bowing when you enter and when you leave.
</p>
<div class="title">Bowing</div>
<p>Stand straight with your hands at your sides, heels together and toes
	at an angle of 45 degrees. Bend slowly forward until fingers touch the
	knees and then stand up again. Do not slap your thighs or curl your
	neck.</p>
<p>
	When performing a seated bow, begin in the same position as the
	standing bow, and then put your left knee on the ground. Continue with
	the right knee and sit on your heels with your back straight and
	looking toward the front. When instructed to bow, or <span
		class="japaneseTerm">rei</span>, place both hands on the floor in
	front of you and bend at the hips until your head touches your hands.
	Do not rise until the person you are bowing to rises. When told to
	stand, raise your body vertically and place your right foot on the
	ground. Stand and bring both feet to <span class="japaneseTerm">musubi
		dachi</span>. Do not place your hands on the floor in order to get up
	or to kneel. Do not be concerned about making a mistake; you will be
	instructed in the proper procedure by another student on your first
	day.
</p>
<div class="title">Standing</div>
<p>It is impolite to stand with your arms crossed or hands on your hips.
	Stand in a natural position, relaxed with your weight on both feet.
	Hands can be in front, behind or to the sides of your body.</p>
<div class="title">Sitting</div>
<p>
	There are only two ways to sit in the <span class="japaneseTerm">dojo</span>:
	formally sitting on your heels in <span class="japaneseTerm">zazen</span>
	or <span class="japaneseTerm">seiza</span> position and cross-legged.
	If you have a medical reason where you cannot sit in these positions,
	you may be allowed to stand or kneel. Ask for permission beforehand.
</p>
<div class="title">Sensei/sempai/kohai</div>
<p>
	The <span class="japaneseTerm">sensei</span>is the teacher or
	instructor. It loosely translates as, &#8220;the person who was there
	before the student.&#8221; <span class="japaneseTerm">Sempai</span> is
	a senior student or anyone who is a higher rank than you. They are <span
		class="japaneseTerm">kohai</span>, or junior student, to the <span
		class="japaneseTerm">sensei</span>. Children are to treat all adults
	as <span class="japaneseTerm">sempai</span>; even if the child is a
	higher rank. This is not to imply the adult can disrespect the ranking
	child; in this case, mutual respect is warranted. When addressed by a
	senior student, the junior student should say, <span
		class="japaneseTerm">osu</span>, and listen attentively. It is
	disrespectful to look around, show &#8220;attitude,&#8221; or ignore
	what they say. They are there to help you; listen and learn.
</p>
<div class="title">Responsibilities/ Duties</div>
<p>
	It is your <span class="japaneseTerm">dojo</span> regardless if it is
	in a gymnasium or a basketball court. When you enter the training area,
	you are to bow and say, <span class="japaneseTerm">osu</span>, loudly
	to let people know you are there. The same is true when you leave. If
	you are late, you will need to bow in formally, say <span
		class="japaneseTerm">osu</span>, and wait quietly to be invited into
	class.
</p>
<p>
	Since we practice in facilities that have more than one use, we must
	remember we are guests in their space and should behave accordingly. We
	should leave the space better than we found it. We can usually get a
	broom to sweep the floor or at least we can pick up any larger pieces
	of trash we see. Locker rooms must be kept neat. Do not leave your
	clothes on the floor or on the benches. This is <b>not</b> your room
	and <span class="japaneseTerm">sensei</span> is <b>not</b> your mother.
</p>
<p>
	Your <span class="japaneseTerm">gi</span>, or uniform should always be
	clean. Ideally, you should have at least two so you can wear one while
	the other is washed. Try not to wear your uniform for more than two
	practices without washing; your fellow <span class="japaneseTerm">karate-ka</span>
	will appreciate it. Your belt, or obi, is to be tied properly. A senior
	student will instruct you on tying the knot on your first day. Learn
	it! <span class="japaneseTerm">Sensei</span> does not tie belts for
	you. Your belt should never touch the floor unless you are wearing it.
	Any belts seen on the floor will be confiscated and not returned until
	you show that you deserve to wear it again.
</p>
<p>
	Your uniform should have an ISKF patch over the left breast and no
	other patches or decorations. If you have experience in another style,
	<i>as a courtesy</i>, you may wear your old uniform and rank until your
	first test. Thereafter, you can only wear a plain white uniform and
	rank you were awarded at your test.<br> <br>Women are to wear a white
	tee-shirt or sports bra under their uniform; many people wear
	compression shorts, supporters, etc. under their uniforms. This is
	allowed as long as it is not visible.
</p>
<p>
	Fingernails and toenails need to be trimmed to avoid injuries to
	yourself and others. Jewelry, watches and rings cannot be worn during
	training. If you have a piercing that is permanent or not easily
	removed, you must wear athletic tape over it at every practice or
	event. No food, gum, smoking or alcohol is allowed in the <span
		class="japaneseTerm">dojo</span>. Profanity is prohibited. Running and
	rough play is not allowed unless it is part of the training. <span
		class="japaneseTerm">Sensei</span> is the <b>only</b> person that can
	make that distinction.
</p>
<p>
	It is the responsibility of all current students to introduce
	themselves to the new students and to make them feel welcome. Offer to
	help them with their practice, answer their questions; in other words,
	treat them as you want to be treated. In this <span
		class="japaneseTerm">dojo</span>, we are all one club, one family.<br>
	<br>When moving around the floor, remember to pass behind other people
	when changing positions. If you have to move farther than two steps,
	you must run to your destination. If you are summoned by a senior
	student or the instructor, you say <span class="japaneseTerm">osu</span>,
	and run to them. When you are assigned to work with a senior student in
	practice, you run to them.
</p>
<p>
	It is your duty to inform the <span class="japaneseTerm">sensei</span>
	if you are injured, ill, or not attending class for an extended period.
	Let your instructor know before class if you need to leave early. Try
	not to disrupt the class as you leave. A leave of absence needs to be
	discussed with the instructor. Speak to the instructor if you decide to
	stop training altogether. It is the polite way to leave and will enable
	you to return later on good terms.
