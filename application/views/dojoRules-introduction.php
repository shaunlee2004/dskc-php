These are rules and regulations for the Dominion Shotokan Karate Club,
LLC (DSKC). They have been designed to help students feel more comfortable from the beginning and instill a basic
knowledge of the culture, terminology and procedures that are required in a
<span class="japaneseTerm">dojo</span>. It will require some time
		and effort during your training to learn the proper procedures, rules
		of <br />etiquette and aspects of Japanese culture. This is understood
		as practicing karate is much different than most endeavors you
		have undertaken in your life thus far. You will make mistakes; learn
		from them. If you have questions, feel free to ask the <span class="japaneseTerm">sensei</span>or a <span class="japaneseTerm">senpai</span> at the proper time. We are
		all here to help you in your journey.<br>
	<br>We practice the Japanese art of Shotokan Karate and are affiliated
		with the International Shotokan Karate Federation (ISKF) <br />headquartered
		in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The chairman and chief instructor is
		Master Teruyuki Okazaki, 10th Dan and a <br />direct student of the
		founder of Shotokan, Master Gichin Funakoshi. All students are
		required to become members of the <br />ISKF and can participate in
		all ISKF tournaments, special trainings, Master Camps and Fall Camps.
		In addition, students <br />who are traveling should be able to
		practice at any ISKF
