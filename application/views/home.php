<p><span class="japaneseTerm">Karate-Do</span> or "Way of the Empty Hand," is a scientific and
	philosophical method of unarmed self defense that developed over many
	centuries and cultures in the far and middle east. Gichin Funakoshi,
	known as the Father of Modern Karate, studied several methods of
	unarmed self-defense and synthesized what he learned into his style,
	called Shotokan.</p>

<p>As a physical regimen, karate is a superb method of exercise and
	discipline. It works all major muscle groups and develops strength,
	coordination, and agility. Students of karate also develop a sense of
	self as well as a mental attitude that is conducive to the growth of
	personal character and respect for oneself and others.</p>

<p>Classes are taught by Steven W. Majors, a <span class="japaneseTerm">yondan</span> with over
	twenty-five years of teaching experience. He is a certified instructor,
	examiner and judge, having completed the official instructor training
	program of the International Shotokan Karate Federation (ISKF).</p>

<p>Dominion Shotokan Karate Club, LLC is a member of the ISKF, an
	international organization that seeks to promulgate traditional
	Japanese <span class="japaneseTerm">karate-do</span> throughout the world.</p>
