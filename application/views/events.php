<div class="title">Tournaments</div>
<p>
	The ISKF hosts several tournaments per year. Regional tournaments are
	held in each of the ISKF districts around the country. Regional winners
	and selected invitees are then eligible for the ISKF Nationals which
	are hosted by a different region each year. The United States Shotokan
	team is selected from the winners and exceptional participants
	nominated by the tournament judges. Each tournament has events for
	children, collegiate, senior and advanced ranks. Tournaments at Master
	and Fall camps have events for adults of all ranks. It is strongly
	encouraged that each member of the <span class="japaneseTerm">dojo</span>
	participates in ISKF tournaments whenever possible.
</p>
<div class="title">Camps</div>

<p>Master and Fall Camps are held at Camp Green Lane, PA in June and September,
	respectively. Master Camp welcomes Shotokan participants from around
	the world to train for up to a week with some of the world's most reknown instructors. Fall Camp is held over a weekend and features
	training by the most elite regional instructors.</p>
<div class="title">Seminars</div>
	
	<p>
	Several times during the year, senior instructors are invited to give
	special trainings at local clubs. We offer special training events
	prior to some <span class="japaneseTerm">kyu </span>exams and put this
	information on our website so that neighboring clubs can attend as
	well. There is usually a small fee required to compensate the
	instructor and their expenses. Again, you are strongly encouraged to attend.
