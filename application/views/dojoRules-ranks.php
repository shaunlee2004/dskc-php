	Originally, there were no belts in karate except those used to hold up
	your pants. Master Jigoro Kano, the founder of <span
		class="japaneseTerm">judo</span>, instituted a belt ranking system consiting of white and black. Later it was deemed necessary
	to have an intermediate level (brown). Eventually another color,
	green, was added between white and brown. This has now evolved into
	the spectrum of colors we have currently. In Shotokan, the belts and
	ranks are:

	White through orange are considered beginner ranks, green and purple
	are intermediate, and brown and black are advanced ranks. It will take,
	at minimum, four years training before you can apply to test for <span
		class="japaneseTerm">dan</span> rank or black belt.
</p>
<p>Testing is an opportunity for students to advance in rank. Tests are
	scheduled four times per year, usually in January, April, July, and October.
	Members must have accrued, at least, 24 classes before being allowed to
	test. This is an minimum of about two classes per week, which is the
	minimum number of classes someone can train. Students testing must pay
	an exam fee and, if membership has expired, a one year membership fee
	to the ISKF. There is no guarantee that you will pass. Remember, it is
	not about belts; it is about perfecting your character.</p>
